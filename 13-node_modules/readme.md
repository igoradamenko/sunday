# node_modules

There is no info about npm, because everybody uses it and know how it works.

But there are some links:

https://registry.npmjs.org

https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md

https://registry.npmjs.org/bem-react-helper

https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/last-day

https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/range/last-month/webpack

https://semver.org

https://semver.npmjs.com

And some tips:

1. It's possible to install modules from git repos not only from npm.

2. Global modules (that installed with `-g`) are called global just because they export their binaries to global scope. 
   It doesn't mean that it's possible to install global module and use it as a project dep.
