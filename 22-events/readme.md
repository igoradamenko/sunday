# Events

Events are handled in the order of handlers declaration.

It's possible to get a list of all event listeners. In browsers it's possible only with [debug tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/utilities#geteventlistenersobject).

`.emit('error')` crashes everything.
